1. **What is Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)?**
    
    - A) A server-side vulnerability that exposes data to unauthorized users.
    - B) A type of security vulnerability where an attacker injects malicious client-side scripts into a web page.
    - C) A method of encrypting data transmitted between a client and server.
    - D) A technique used to monitor and analyze web traffic for suspicious activities.
2. **Which of the following best describes a stored XSS attack?**
    
    - A) Injecting malicious code into a web page through a URL.
    - B) Malicious code is stored in a website's database and executed when a page is accessed.
    - C) The attacker tricks a user into executing a script via a phishing email.
    - D) Malicious code is injected directly into server-side scripts.
3. **In a reflected XSS attack, how is the malicious code injected?**
    
    - A) Through the website's database.
    - B) By embedding it in a URL that the victim clicks on.
    - C) By sending it through a form submission on the website.
    - D) By inserting it into server-side log files.
4. **Which of the following is NOT a recommended method for preventing XSS attacks?**
    
    - A) Input validation and sanitization
    - B) Content Security Policy (CSP)
    - C) Encoding user input
    - D) Allowing HTML tags in user input
5. **What does Content Security Policy (CSP) do in the context of XSS prevention?**
    
    - A) Encrypts the userâ€™s data before it is sent to the server.
    - B) Specifies which sources of content are allowed to be loaded by the browser.
    - C) Automatically updates the website's database to remove malicious code.
    - D) Validates user input on the client-side before it is sent to the server.
6. **Why is escaping user input important for XSS prevention?**
    
    - A) It encrypts the user input before storing it in the database.
    - B) It prevents special characters from being interpreted as code.
    - C) It validates input to ensure it matches a specific format.
    - D) It restricts the length of user input to avoid buffer overflow attacks.
7. **Which technique involves converting user input into a format that can be safely displayed on the website?**
    
    - A) Input validation
    - B) Content Security Policy (CSP)
    - C) Escaping user input
    - D) Encoding user input
8. **What should be used in combination to effectively mitigate the risk of XSS attacks?**
    
    - A) Regular software updates and patches
    - B) A combination of input validation, CSP, escaping, encoding, and disabling HTML in user input
    - C) Strong passwords and two-factor authentication
    - D) Encryption of all data transmitted between client and server
9. **How can disabling HTML in user input help prevent XSS attacks?**
    
    - A) By reducing the amount of data stored in the database
    - B) By preventing users from injecting malicious HTML tags and attributes
    - C) By encrypting HTML content before rendering it on the webpage
    - D) By limiting the number of characters that can be input by users
10. **What is the primary goal of XSS attacks?**
    
- A) To gain unauthorized access to server-side data
- B) To manipulate how a web page is displayed or execute malicious commands
- C) To encrypt user data in transit
- D) To perform denial-of-service attacks on the web server
