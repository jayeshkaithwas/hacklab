I recently attempted the **Certified AppSec Practitioner (CAP)** exam and passed it on my first try. The CAP exam is a 60-minute multiple-choice exam (MCQs) hosted by **The SecOps Group**. To pass, you need to score at least 60% by correctly answering questions that test your knowledge of both the defensive and offensive sides of cybersecurity. If youâ€™re preparing for the exam, you can find the full syllabus on the [SecOps Group website](https://secops.group/pentesting-exams/certified-application-security-practitioner/).

Here I am sharing the MCQ's which I have used to prepare for the exam.
