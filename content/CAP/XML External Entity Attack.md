#### XML External Entity Attack Overview

1. **What is an XML External Entity (XXE) attack?**
    
    - A) A type of attack that exploits a vulnerability in a SQL parser
    - B) An attack that exploits a vulnerability in an XML parser
    - C) A denial of service attack on a web server
    - D) An attack that uses encrypted XML documents
2. **Which of the following is another name for XML External Entity attacks?**
    
    - A) XML Injection
    - B) SQL Injection
    - C) Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
    - D) Command Injection
3. **What does an XXE attack typically exploit?**
    
    - A) Weak authentication mechanisms
    - B) Vulnerabilities in XML parsers
    - C) Flaws in web server configurations
    - D) Issues in network protocols

#### How XXE Attacks Work

4. **What is the main cause of vulnerability in an XML parser that allows XXE attacks?**
    
    - A) Lack of encryption
    - B) Improper validation of XML documents
    - C) Insecure data storage
    - D) Poor network security
5. **In an XXE attack, what is typically sent to the vulnerable XML parser?**
    
    - A) An encrypted XML document
    - B) A specially crafted XML document containing malicious code
    - C) A plain text file
    - D) A SQL query
6. **What can malicious code in an XXE attack be used for?**
    
    - A) Optimizing XML queries
    - B) Gaining access to sensitive data or network systems
    - C) Encrypting XML documents
    - D) Improving XML parser performance

#### Examples of XXE Attacks

7. **Which type of XXE attack involves causing a denial of service (DoS) attack?**
    
    - A) XML Injection
    - B) XML Bombing
    - C) XXE Injection
    - D) XML Encryption
8. **What does XXE Injection specifically target?**
    
    - A) Data integrity
    - B) Network system access or arbitrary code execution
    - C) XML schema validation
    - D) XML document formatting
9. **Which of the following is NOT a type of XXE attack mentioned in the text?**
    
    - A) XML Injection
    - B) XML Bombing
    - C) XXE Injection
    - D) XML Encryption

#### Prevention Techniques

10. **What should be done to avoid parsing malicious entities in XML documents?**
    
    - A) Encrypt the XML document
    - B) Validate and filter all external resources
    - C) Disable logging in XML parsers
    - D) Use older versions of XML parsers
11. **How can organizations prevent XXE attacks?**
    
    - A) By using the latest XML parsers with security features
    - B) By ignoring XML document validation
    - C) By using outdated security protocols
    - D) By increasing parser processing speed
12. **What is a recommended practice when dealing with untrusted XML documents?**
    
    - A) Set the entity resolver to an empty object
    - B) Use unencrypted XML files
    - C) Allow all external entities
    - D) Avoid input validation
13. **Why is it important to check for the presence of a DTD in XML documents?**
    
    - A) To ensure XML documents are encrypted
    - B) Because DTDs can be used to enable XXE attacks
    - C) To optimize XML parsing speed
    - D) To validate XML document structure
14. **What can a Content Security Policy (CSP) help prevent in the context of XXE attacks?**
    
    - A) Data loss
    - B) Exploitation of XXE vulnerabilities
    - C) Encryption issues
    - D) Network slowdowns
15. **What role does input validation play in preventing XXE attacks?**
    
    - A) It helps detect and prevent malicious entities from being parsed
    - B) It improves XML parsing speed
    - C) It encrypts XML documents
    - D) It manages network traffic
