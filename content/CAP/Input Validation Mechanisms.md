1. **What is the primary purpose of input validation?**
	- A) To enhance application performance
	- B) To limit user input to required functionality
	- C) To improve user experience
	- D) To format data for reporting

2. **At which levels should input validation be performed?**
	- A) Syntactical and Contextual
	- B) Syntactical and Semantic
	- C) Structural and Semantic
	- D) Contextual and Structural

3. **Which of the following is an example of syntactical validation?**
	- A) Ensuring a phone number has a specific format
	- B) Checking if a date is valid within a given context
	- C) Verifying if an email address is correctly formatted
	- D) Ensuring a user cannot enter a date in the past

4. **What is semantic validation concerned with?**
	- A) The format of the input data
	- B) The correctness of input values within a given context
	- C) The length of the input data
	- D) The presence of certain characters in the input

5. **Why is it important to validate input on both the frontend and backend?**
	- A) To enhance the design of the application
	- B) To prevent vulnerabilities from modified requests
	- C) To speed up the data entry process
	- D) To improve the application's responsiveness

6. **What method should be used to ensure input conforms to specific schemas like JSON or XML?**
	- A) Exception handling
	- B) Regular expressions
	- C) Data type specification
	- D) Strict validation checks

7. **What is a common approach for handling file uploads securely?**
	- A) Validate only the file extension
	- B) Allow all file types but scan for malware
	- C) Validate the file size and extension, and scan for malicious content
	- D) Rename files with random names but do not validate them

8. **Why is it important to validate email addresses on both the client and server sides?**
	- A) To prevent email spoofing
	- B) To ensure emails are correctly formatted and actually exist
	- C) To avoid email server downtime
	- D) To improve email marketing effectiveness

9. **Which approach to handling input validation errors involves generating a security error and redirecting to a generic error page?**
	- A) Recovering
	- B) Failing
	- C) Logging
	- D) Sanitizing

10. **What is a key disadvantage of the "failing" approach in input validation?**
    - A) It can mask malicious input
    - B) It may disrupt the user experience and lose transactions
    - C) It is less secure than recovering
    - D) It requires more complex coding

11. **How should the file path of an uploaded file be set to ensure security?**
    - A) On the client side
    - B) On the server side
    - C) By the user
    - D) Dynamically based on user input

12. **Which tool is used for validating email addresses in PHP?**
    - A) Apache Commons Validator
    - B) PHP filter functions
    - C) OWASP Java HTML Sanitizer
    - D) Java Hibernate Validator

13. **What should be done to handle special characters in user input effectively?**
    - A) Encode them
    - B) Remove them
    - C) Ignore them
    - D) Allow all special characters

14. **When validating file uploads, what aspect should not be ignored?**
    - A) File path
    - B) File content
    - C) File creation date
    - D) File name length

15. **What is the purpose of using regular expressions in input validation?**
    - A) To define the range of allowed characters
    - B) To check the entire string rather than just parts of it
    - C) To validate the file type
    - D) To limit the size of the input

16. **Why might blacklisting email addresses be problematic?**
    - A) It may be ineffective as new domains can be easily created
    - B) It requires too much server processing power
    - C) It is less secure than whitelisting
    - D) It is not compatible with many email clients

17. **What should be done when a validation error occurs to aid in investigation?**
    - A) Display detailed error messages to the user
    - B) Log the error in the application logs
    - C) Ignore the error if itâ€™s not critical
    - D) Redirect the user to a custom error page

18. **Which library is specifically designed for sanitizing HTML content in Java?**
    - A) OWASP Java HTML Sanitizer Project
    - B) Java Hibernate Validator
    - C) Apache Commons Validator
    - D) JEP-290

19. **What is one approach to validate file content before accepting uploads?**
    - A) Use regex to check the file extension
    - B) Validate the file size and scan for malicious content
    - C) Allow all file types and rely on user trust
    - D) Rename files to prevent security issues

20. **What is the purpose of using UUIDs for file uploads?**
    - A) To ensure the file name is unique and not predictable
    - B) To make file names shorter
    - C) To improve file upload speed
    - D) To comply with email address validation rules
