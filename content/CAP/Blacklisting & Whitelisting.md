1. **What does blacklisting involve in input validation?**
    - A) Allowing only known good input
    - B) Rejecting input that is known to be bad
    - C) Accepting all input and filtering later
    - D) Validating input against a whitelist

2. **Why is blacklisting considered weaker than whitelisting?**
    - A) It is easier to implement
    - B) It is harder to maintain and keep up to date
    - C) It allows more input types
    - D) It provides a complete security solution

3. **What is a common method of implementing blacklisting?**    
    - A) Data type validation
    - B) Regular expressions
    - C) Output encoding
    - D) Data range checks

4. **In the context of blacklisting, what is a common issue with rejecting known bad content?**
    - A) It may miss new types of malicious input
    - B) It is more secure than whitelisting
    - C) It always guarantees complete protection
    - D) It is less computationally intensive

5. **Whitelisting involves:**    
    - A) Accepting input that is known to be good
    - B) Rejecting input that matches a blacklist
    - C) Using regular expressions to find known bad patterns
    - D) Allowing all input and filtering it later

6. **What is a key advantage of whitelisting over blacklisting?**
    - A) It requires less maintenance
    - B) It ensures only known good input is accepted
    - C) It is easier to implement
    - D) It allows all types of input

7. **Which of the following is an example of data validation in whitelisting?**
    - A) Ensuring a ZIP Code matches the format `^\d{5}(-\d{4})?$`
    - B) Rejecting input containing `<SCRIPT>`
    - C) Allowing any string but encoding special characters
    - D) Using a blacklist to filter bad inputs

8. **What does the regular expression `^\d{5}(-\d{4})?$` validate?**
    - A) A U.S. phone number
    - B) A U.S. ZIP Code
    - C) An email address
    - D) A credit card number

9. **Why might implementing whitelisting be challenging?**
    - A) It is generally less secure than blacklisting
    - B) It can be difficult to anticipate all possible valid inputs
    - C) It is simpler than blacklisting
    - D) It requires no special handling for complex inputs

10. **What is the primary goal of an input validation and handling strategy?**
    - A) To filter out all potential malicious inputs
    - B) To ensure multiple layers of defense are applied
    - C) To validate only the most common input types
    - D) To perform data encryption before storage

11. **How is input validation performed at the client’s browser in the strategy?**
    - A) By using a web application firewall (WAF)
    - B) By implementing parameterized statements
    - C) By applying whitelist validation
    - D) By encoding data within the database

12. **What is the purpose of using parameterized statements in the input validation strategy?**
    - A) To perform safe SQL execution
    - B) To validate input against a whitelist
    - C) To encode data for XSS protection
    - D) To filter out known bad content

13. **How should data extracted from the database be handled according to the strategy?**
    - A) It should be validated against a blacklist
    - B) It should be encoded appropriately before use
    - C) It should be directly displayed without modification
    - D) It should be filtered for malicious content

14. **What role does a Web Application Firewall (WAF) play in the input validation strategy?**
    - A) It replaces the need for client-side validation
    - B) It provides intrusion detection/prevention and monitors attacks
    - C) It exclusively performs blacklisting
    - D) It handles encoding and decoding of data

15. **What is a key benefit of combining whitelisting with output encoding?**
    - A) It provides a complete solution without additional controls
    - B) It enhances protection by validating and safely handling data
    - C) It simplifies the validation process by removing all bad data
    - D) It guarantees no need for further validation or security measures

16. **When using blacklisting, what should be used in conjunction with it for better security?**    
    - A) Output encoding
    - B) Regular expressions only
    - C) Only client-side validation
    - D) Data size checks

17. **What does whitelist validation ensure about the input data?**
    - A) It is only checked for known bad patterns
    - B) It conforms to a set of known good standards and formats
    - C) It is validated for size and range only
    - D) It is checked against a list of common security threats

18. **What is a typical challenge when implementing whitelist validation in applications with large character sets?**
    - A) Difficulty in maintaining blacklists
    - B) The need for constant updates to the blacklist
    - C) Complex input types and extensive character sets
    - D) Limited application of validation rules

19. **What should be done if an application receives input that is not in the expected form?**    
    - A) Ignore the input and proceed
    - B) Log the issue and continue processing
    - C) Reject the input and handle it as an error
    - D) Accept the input but sanitize it later

20. **In a defense-in-depth strategy, what role does input validation play?**    
    - A) It is the sole security measure
    - B) It is part of a broader set of multiple defense layers
    - C) It replaces the need for encryption and data encoding
    - D) It exclusively focuses on client-side data handling
