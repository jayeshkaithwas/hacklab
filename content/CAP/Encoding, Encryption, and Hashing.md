1. **What is the primary purpose of encoding?**
    
    - A) To secure data from unauthorized access
    - B) To transform data into an unreadable format
    - C) To represent data in a different format, often for obfuscation or compression
    - D) To verify the integrity of data
2. **Which of the following is NOT a type of encoding?**
    
    - A) Base64 Encoding
    - B) URL Encoding
    - C) SHA-2 Encoding
    - D) UTF-8 Encoding
3. **What is the main characteristic of symmetric encryption?**
    
    - A) It uses two different keys for encryption and decryption
    - B) It uses the same key for both encryption and decryption
    - C) It converts data into a fixed-length hash
    - D) It is used to compress data
4. **Which encryption method uses a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption?**
    
    - A) Symmetric Encryption
    - B) Asymmetric Encryption
    - C) MD5 Encryption
    - D) Base64 Encryption
5. **Which of the following is a common algorithm used in symmetric encryption?**
    
    - A) RSA
    - B) MD5
    - C) AES
    - D) SHA-3
6. **What is the purpose of hashing?**
    
    - A) To convert binary data into ASCII characters
    - B) To encrypt data so that it is unreadable without a key
    - C) To generate a fixed-length output for data verification and secure password storage
    - D) To compress data for more efficient storage
7. **Which hashing algorithm generates a 128-bit hash value?**
    
    - A) SHA-1
    - B) SHA-3

8. **What does a hash function do with data?**
    
    - A) Converts it into a format that is readable by humans
    - B) Encrypts it using a secret key
    - C) Generates a fixed-length output that represents the original data
    - D) Obfuscates it for data compression
9. **Which type of encryption is considered more secure due to the use of two different keys?**
    
    - A) Symmetric Encryption
    - B) Asymmetric Encryption
    - C) Base64 Encoding
